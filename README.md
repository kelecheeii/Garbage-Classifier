**Report on Multi-Modal Garbage Classification Model Training and Evaluation**

**1. Introduction**
This report presents the training and evaluation of a multi-modal classification model that integrates text and image data for garbage classification. The model is trained and validated using a dataset containing four categories: Black, Blue, Green, and TTR. The primary objective was to improve classification accuracy while minimizing validation loss.

**2. Training Process**
The model was trained using a dataset on a CPU environment with a total of 20 epochs, although early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting. The following training parameters were used:
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate**: Adaptive (Cosine Annealing Scheduler)
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.3
- **Pre-trained Models**: DistilBERT for text processing, ResNet-18 for image processing

**3. Training and Validation Performance**
The training process recorded continuous improvement in both accuracy and validation loss across epochs. Below are key metrics from selected epochs:

| Epoch | Train Loss | Train Accuracy | Val Loss | Val Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| 1     | 0.5030    | 81.37%        | 0.3435   | 86.83%       |
| 2     | 0.2918    | 89.78%        | 0.3007   | 89.28%       |
| 3     | 0.2258    | 92.25%        | 0.3003   | 89.44%       |
| 4     | 0.1873    | 93.71%        | 0.2903   | 89.56%       |
| 5     | 0.1550    | 94.90%        | 0.2892   | 90.50%       |
| 6     | 0.1505    | 95.03%        | 0.2823   | 89.78%       |
| 7     | 0.1485    | 95.05%        | 0.2943   | 90.06%       |
| 9     | 0.1575    | 94.53%        | 0.3153   | 89.89%       |

After **Epoch 9**, early stopping was triggered due to increasing validation loss, preventing further training to avoid overfitting.

**4. Model Testing and Performance Evaluation**
The best model was loaded from the saved checkpoint and evaluated on the test set.
- **Test Loss**: 0.4224
- **Test Accuracy**: 86%

A **confusion matrix** was generated to analyze misclassifications. The results indicate strong classification performance, with most misclassified samples belonging to visually similar or textually ambiguous categories. The confusion matrix is presented below:

**5. Observations and Key Findings**
- The model achieved a **high classification accuracy of 86%** on the test set, demonstrating effective learning from multi-modal inputs.
- **Validation loss started increasing after Epoch 6**, indicating potential overfitting.
- **Early stopping at Epoch 9** helped maintain generalization performance.
- The confusion matrix highlights **minor misclassifications**, mainly due to category similarities.

**6. Recommendations for Future Improvements**
To further enhance the modelâ€™s performance, the following steps are recommended:
- **Regularization techniques**: Increasing dropout rates to further prevent overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Experimenting with different learning rates and batch sizes.
- **Data augmentation**: Adding more variations in image preprocessing to improve robustness.
- **Feature standardization**: Applying normalization layers for text/image embeddings.
- **Ensemble learning**: Combining multiple models to improve classification reliability.

**7. Conclusion**
The training and evaluation process demonstrated that the multi-modal classifier effectively distinguishes garbage categories using both image and text features. Despite minor misclassifications, the model performed well, achieving an 86% accuracy on the test set. Future enhancements could improve its robustness and classification precision.
